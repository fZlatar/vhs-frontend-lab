I'm not 100% sure but there might be a problem with thumbnail images and storing them. As I sent post request to a backend with thumbnail i would get response with thumbnail different than null but the image was not saved in directory.

The app could use some touches as error handling for unsupported routes, hover effects and some animations using framer motion (especially header when opening search bar). The images are the only thing that does not work and I don't have any documentation about the backend about that so I'm not sure how to fix that (or is it the problem with backend).
