I'm not 100% sure but there might be a problem with thumbnail images and storing them. As I sent post request to a backend with thumbnail i would get response with thumbnail different than null but the image was not saved in directory.

The app could use some touches as error handling for unsupported routes, hover effects and some animations using framer motion (especially header when opening search bar). The images are the only thing that does not work and I don't have any documentation about the backend about that so I'm not sure how to fix that (or is it the problem with backend). There is also a bug with themes when in dark theme and go to another page there is flickering (There is some functionality within Chakra UI that saves theme in cookies and than We intercept them in Next server so we return page with correct theme every time but I could not make it work for some reason). There is also a possibility to clean up the code and put a lot of "css in js" to theme configuration (for example we can put default Flex component props to theme config file, so that we do not need to write justifyContent, flexDir, alignItems... within every Flex component)
